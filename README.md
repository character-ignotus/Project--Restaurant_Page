# Project: "Restaurant Page"

## Description of project: 
A simple restaurant WebPage with three different pages (Home, Menu & Contacts page) accessed by tabbed browsing, the contents of which are generated entirely by JavaScript. The main focus of the project is the usage npm, package.json, the webpack module bundler, different loaders for website assets, plugins & the utilization of ES6 modules to seperate the different functionalities into there own modules which are then exported & imported by the the index.js file (All the .js files, as well as stylesheets, images, fonts etc. are located inside of a 'src' folder). The index.js file then bundles the different modules, as well as the stylesheet (which is also imported inside of it) into a final bundle.js file linked with the index.html file, both of which files are generated into there own folder called "dist". To sum it up, the aim of the project is to set up a Webpack dev environment & use it to build a WebPage. You can check the Restaurant Page [here](https://character-ignotus.github.io/Project--Restaurant_Page/).
